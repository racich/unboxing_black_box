    "## Polynomial Features\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpreting-interactions-in-regression/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake VanderPlas writes about [polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.04-feature-engineering.html) for those who want more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we create polynomial features using the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. [Scikit-Learn has a useful class called `PolynomialFeatures`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py))."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we saw how to get started with a Kaggle machine learning competition. We first made sure to understand the data, our task, and the metric by which our submissions will be judged. Then, we performed a fairly simple EDA to try and identify relationships, trends, or anomalies that may help our modeling. Along the way, we performed necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and scaling features to a range. Then, we constructed new features out of the existing data to see if doing so could help our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data exploration, data preparation, and feature engineering was complete, we implemented a baseline model upon which we hope to improve. Then we built a second slightly more complicated model to beat our first score. We also carried out an experiment to determine the effect of adding the engineering variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "Machine learning competitions do differ slightly from typical data science problems in that we are concerned only with achieving the best performance on a single metric and do not care about the interpretation. However, by attempting to understand how our models make decisions, we can try to improve them or examine the mistakes in order to correct the errors. In future notebooks we will look at incorporating more sources of data, building more complex models (by following the code of others), and improving our scores.\n",

    "__Running the notebook__: now that we are at the end of the notebook, you can hit the blue Commit & Run button to execute all the code at once. After the run is complete (this should take about 10 minutes), you can then access the files that were created by going to the versions tab and then the output sub-tab. The submission files can be directly submitted to the competition from this tab or they can be downloaded to a local machine and saved. The final part is to share the share the notebook: go to the settings tab and change the visibility to Public. This allows the entire world to see your work!\n",

    "\n",
    "Now (if you want, this part is entirely optional) we can step off the deep end and use a real machine learning model: the [gradient boosting machine](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning/) using the [LightGBM library](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quick-Start.html)! The Gradient Boosting Machine is currently the leading model for learning on structured datasets (especially on Kaggle) and we will probably need some form of this model to do well in the competition. Don't worry, even if this code looks intimidating, it's just a series of small steps that build up to a complete model. I added this code just to show what may be in store for this project, and because it gets us a slightly better score on the leaderboard. In future notebooks we will see how to work with more advanced models (which mostly means adapting existing code to make it work better), feature engineering, and feature selection. See you in the next notebook!"
